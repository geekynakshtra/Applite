# Few-Shot Learning on CIFAR-100 with MobileNetV2

This repository contains a simple implementation of few-shot learning on the CIFAR-100 dataset using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. The goal is to demonstrate how to fine-tune a pre-trained model on a small subset of data for each class.

## Overview

- **Dataset**: CIFAR-100
- **Model**: MobileNetV2 pre-trained on ImageNet
- **Task**: Few-shot learning with 5 examples per class

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- scikit-learn
- numpy
